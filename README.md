Automated Durometer


MRSD Project:

In this project my team and I (4 members) are focused on creating a modular robotic platform. Modules have been broken out based on different functions, such as perception, locomotion, and brain. We use ROS for inter-module communication over ethernet.

For this modular platform we built a mobile robot for the first semester consisting of a perception module, locomotion module, and brain module. The perception module was a pan/tilt Kinect camera which could be used for line sensing and tele-operation. The locomotion module was a differential drive system using 2 DC motors and caster wheels for support. The brain module was an Intel-i3 computer running ROS and controlling all other modules, a 24V battery, and voltage converter.
